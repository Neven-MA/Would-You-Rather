*project description
a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game
where he is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”

*planning for the project
1-I started by creating the store and its actions, middleware & reducers
2-after that I started creating react components using Semantic UI and passed them the required state from the store
3-6-I checked everything to make sure they work properly
